We use hooks for data and components for visuals

A component owns a hook

Generic components go in the /components folder

view-specific components go in that view's folder under /views/<ViewName>/components

repeat yourself once. Just not twice. (don't make a component for something that's only re-used once)

store structure for `useXData()` hooks?
