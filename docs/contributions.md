## Coding Style

We use the default options supplied by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), please make sure your editor has it enabled before developing.

(Maybe we should just use Google's -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html (except for formatting) (I read a bunch of it and didn't find anything I disagreed with.))

## Branches

We create branches off `develop`
