# Our architecture

### We deal with money

Testing and accuracy needs to be our priority when designing this codebase. The architectural decisions here have been made with the main goal of enabling testing at as many levels as possible. We have highly testable usecases, highly testable integration services, and a highly testable end to end stack.

### We are in an incredibly volitile fast moving market

So whilst testing is important in this space change is also to be expected so our code must be as flexible as possible. We cannot assume our code structure will remain fixed we will likley need to refactor our backing services change the way we access our technology, change our frontend. Provide API sdks and libraries based on our code. Also our important business processes things like the fees we charge invariants and business rules need to be well tested or at least when they are simple easy to add tests as we go.

- **CHANGE** is expected
- Complex business rules are likely (margin trading, limit orders, exceptions, security features)
- Protocols will likely change
- Backing services may move
- Contract calls signatures and methods may change
- Business logic may change (or not)

### We are growing fast

We are growing fast as an industry and some level of team churn should be expected we should strive to avoid knowledge silos and optimize for quick onboarding where possible. SO clarity and consistency should be somethign we value in our codebase.

### Our architecture goals

It makes sense that our architecture should be alogned with these goals that we should optimize for:

1. TESTABILITY
1. FLEXIBILITY
1. CLARITY
1. CONSISTENCY

### Questions for our code

Looking at our code and architecture we should be able to glean certain information reasonably easily.

- What does this application **do**?
- What external **services** does my app rely on?
- What does the **data** in my app look like?
- How can I **test** edge cases easily?
- Can I easily change deployment environment:
  - change my external services?
  - add a cache layer?
  - create a mobile app?
  - create a cli?

âœ… Our architectural approach answers these questions

### CLEAN ARCHITECTURE

Hexagonal or clean architecture solves many of these concerns. We support a simplified version of clean architecture to help us achieve our goals.

- View - Present the UI
- Usecase - Encapsulated Application Specific Logic
- Service - Pass data to and from externalities
- Entity - Shared data structure and logic

Here is a [great short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnailTcJV_U) on the most important concepts I highly recommend you watch if you are not familiar with Clean Architecture. Watching this should give you a good gist of how it works.

### Hmm ok so how should I think about this?

- We are **usecase** centric every feature needs a usecase
- Usecases know nothing they are totally portable as they depend on nothing that is not injected.
- **Services** are plugins to the usecases that allow usecases to interact with the outside world. Services pass data to and from externalities. Testing these can be difficult so they might need to be tested in e2e tests or integration tests (we do both but might depricate integration tests eventually)
- Pass data to an encapsulation using function calls
- Receive data from an encapsulation using:
  - return values for sync values
  - shared event bus for async events (ok).
  - async iterator (via generator) for async events (best).

---

### summary

- TESTABILITY - dependency inversion allows services to be swapped out for testing
- FLEXIBILITY - logic is independent of deployment, representation or frameworks
- CLARITY - code reads like a list of feature requirements
- CONSISTENCY - features consist of usecases - externalities are services - view should trigger usecases hold limited smarts and react to events

## Benefits of this architecture

- Better conceptual parity with user

  - Usecases demonstrates the business rules the way the business thinks about it

- Hides useless complexity

  - Details of how we serialize a blockchain transaction is irrelavent to knowing that fees are paid in ceth and that a user must have anough funds inside their wallet to cover that amount. In CA these things are separate.

- Very testable

  - Can test usecases with basic dependency injection

- Future proof

  - Assuming we make good decisions on what is "business logic"
  - Margin trading will require complex usecase scenarios
  - IBC will require lots of complex fee rules

- Avoids complex hard to follow and hard to test event chains

  - Often in Redux based architectures we have cascading events driving cascading events

- Allows for portability of business logic
  - Mobile app
  - React compatability (actually underway in sdk)
  - Console UI
- Independent of framework
- Independent of backing service
  - Can change the underlying service library without affecting the UI or the business logic
- With minor maintenance grows fairly naturally
- Universal methodology for designing systems
