# Deployment

As follows is our branching model:

- Push to `develop` builds to `https://devnet.sifchain.finance`
- Push a tag name to `develop` builds to `https://testnet.sifchain.finance`
  - Recommended: run `yarn bump:app` from `ui/` folder or `yarn bump` from `ui/app` folder, it will create the commit&tag for you.
  - Remember to `git push --tags` to get the tag to push.
  - Run `yarn bump --push` to have it push for you!
- Merge to `master` builds to `https://dex.sifchain.finance`

# Releases and showing a changelog

- The app shows a "changelog" modal that shows the CHANGELOG.md from the commit SHA at which the most recent release was built.
- Additionally, when a new version is published (via updating the version in package.json and deploying), a small badge will be displayed on the changelog item in the sidemenu until the user reads it.

This means that each release, there are two things to do:

1. Update [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) with the latest changes for the release and push.
2. Run `npm version <minor|major|patch>` within app folder and push.
3. Deploy this versions and user will get a little badge on the changelog since a new version is out.
