* Show price impact ?
* Show swap fee as both percentage and amount ? 
* Show liquidity (TVL) instead of Pool Depth (which is half of TVL)

Hey I was asked to post my critic of the app here, I hope this finds you well. I'm not an UX designer, I'm a motion/graphic designer so take that into the account:

I honestly don't like the overall design at all, it reminds me of a fairytale book store. It doesn't feel like a technology/crypto app. You may say it's subjective and that this is your identity. Yes, I agree - while you should keep some of your identity, you should also consider of what users are used to see when engaging with one of these apps. Design trends are more like "less is more" in the last few years - this is because of the instant gratification that most of the users are seeking, so they need to see important info ASAP. 

The practice is to keep the identity in small elements of your page (your logo, icons and graphics that take less then 10% of the all content) but everything else needs to be CLEAN.

For example, background images are just making important things harder to see - lots of noise. 

The choice of family for heading font is just hard to read, also the color is too bright on the white background which has a very bad contrast and is additionally harder to read. This can be solved by adding more of that color, in case of fonts, make them heavier but I'm pretty sure this font has only one weight. I'd personally change the family of the font.

Serif fonts as a text also implies this has something to do with books. Italic fonts also in general harder to read.

Your landing page should be your selling page, and user should now what are they engaging with within 3 seconds. Then you take the overall concept from the landing page and "spread" the design over the other parts of your website as well. 


FR from @SkeletorCrypto: 
A feature that I would like to see implemented is the following one: from the Swap UI when you drag the mouse over the logo of the tokens you're swapping a little pop-up window appears and it shows the token price on the Dex and the arbitrage opportunity (same as pool stats tab). This way the user should not jump between tabs to see all the relevant info to optimize his swap transactions.
